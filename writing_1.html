        <h2>Re-enchantment of the Modern World</h2>
        <p>Two years before the Treaty of Versailles would be signed, German philosopher and lawyer Max Weber warned his students in Munich that “the fate of our times” is the “disenchantment of the world” (Weber 155). While fitting into the context of the end of the First World War, the statement that mystery, magic and religion were disappearing from a world dominated by bureaucracy and industry resonated deeply with people everywhere. In recent years, Weber’s paradigm of disenchantment has been challenged by post-modern thinkers: The “’disenchantment of the world’ is not a completed project of comprehensive global reach” (Bilgrami 1), this is to say that that disenchantment, as Weber claimed, is an empirically emergent phenomenon. The feeling of disenchantment can stem from either religious or secular motivations, and there are valid concerns with how mainstream religion transitioned to that of asceticism and devotion, and how esotericism in the West became a marginalized topic, which led to mass theistical disenchantment. There are also equal concerns about the human condition in alignment to a larger societal perspective due to forces like capitalism and anthropocentrism. I postulate secular re-enchantment arises from within, following the healing of our relationships with nature and those within and outside our sphere of obligation. </p>
